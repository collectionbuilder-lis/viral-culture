## Critical Context

Starting in the 1980s, artists, collectives, and other political groups were founded in response to the lack of government intervention in the AIDS epidemic. Many protestors engaged in direct action tactics such as phone zaps, fax zaps, sit-ins in government offices, vigils, die-ins, kiss-ins, marches and demonstrations, and wheat pasting posters in public spaces. Agitprop art was made to provoke the public and as a call to action.

This collection draws attention to the diffuse coalitional nature of various direct action anti-AIDS movements and to highlight how the political, emotional, and cultural dimensions of protest are linked together. This collection focuses on cultural production, that is objects such as ephemera, events such as protest, and spaces such as archives, memorials, and museums that occur external to science and government.

**Affect in the Archive**

Since the 1990s, there has been a shift in cultural theory and criticism towards a focus on affect. Now known as 'the affective turn,' scholars in the humanities and social sciences have increasingly focused on studying emotions and feelings as legitimate objects inquiry. These approaches intertwine theories concerning subjectivity, the body, critical analysis, and political theories in innovative ways. While affect theory remains a dynamic field, it underscores the importance of understanding how emotions and feelings shape human experiences and societal dynamics. At its core, affect is the force connecting the body and sensation with the external world.

Projects within the affective turn invoke the language and metaphor of 'the archive' while focusing on issues that pertain to archival concerns in social justice paradigms, such as representation, identity, bodies, accountability, collective memory, and community empowerment. While these projects may not directly engage with archives as traditionally defined in archival studies, they provide valuable insights, theoretical frameworks, and approaches that can contribute significantly to discussions within the archival field and foster interdisciplinary exchange.
