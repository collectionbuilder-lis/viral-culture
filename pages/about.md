## Critical Context

Starting in the 1980s, several artist groups, collectives, and other political groups were founded in response to the lack of government intervention in the AIDS epidemic. Many protestors engaged in direct action tactics such as phone zaps, fax zaps, sit-ins in government offices, vigils, die-ins, kiss-ins, marches and demonstrations, and wheat pasting posters in public spaces. Agitprop art was made to provoke the public and as a call to action.

This collection draws attention to the diffuse coalitional nature of various direct action anti-AIDS movements and the use of camp and humor in protest which highlights how the political, emotional, and cultural dimensions of protest are linked together. Queer feminist protest ephemera extends beyond AIDS activism to contemporary movements for queer liberation, trans rights, and more. This collection focuses on cultural production, that is objects such as ephemera, events such as protest, and spaces such as archives, memorials, and museums that occur external to science and government.
